CS 6301.002.  Implementation of advanced data structures and algorithms
Spring 2016
Short Project 5 (Permutations and combinations)
Thu, Apr 7, 2016

Ver 1.0: Initial description (Apr 7, 3:00 PM).

Due: 1:00 PM, Thu, Apr 14.
Solve at least one problem from the following list. First solution will be graded out of 10. Each additional problem will be considered for 1 extra point.
a. Permutations and combinations

Implement the following algorithms discussed in class: (a) Combination(A, n, k), (b) Permute(A, n). For Permute(), implement Take 2 and Heap's algorithms, and compare their running times for n = 8..14.
b. nPk

Combine the solutions to part a to get Permute(A, n, k): ordered sets of cardinality k from a set of size n.
c. Knuth's L algorithm

Implement Knuth's algorithm for generating permutations in lexicographic order.
d. Enumeration of topological orders in DAGs

Given a DAG as input (use input format used by readGraph), visit and print all topological orders of the graph.
